# Viral Medium Blog Writer

## Overview

Write technical blog posts optimized for viral success on Medium, specifically for web development and software architecture topics. Apply research-backed strategies including storytelling structure, optimal formatting, headline formulas, and launch tactics to maximize engagement and reach.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User asks to write a blog post for Medium
- User requests help creating technical content about web development or software architecture
- User wants to optimize existing content for Medium's algorithm
- User needs guidance on viral blog post structure and formatting

Example triggers:
- "Write a blog post about microservices"
- "Create a viral Medium post explaining React hooks"
- "Help me write an article about software architecture patterns"
- "Turn this technical documentation into an engaging Medium post"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Topic and Angle

Clarify the technical topic and identify the unique angle that will make it compelling:

**Questions to ask:**
- What technical problem or concept should the post address?
- What personal experience or unique perspective can be shared?
- What struggle or "aha moment" hooks the story?
- What specific value will readers get? (problem solved, time saved, new understanding)

**Finding the Viral Angle:**
- **Story + Solution** beats pure documentation
- **"I struggled, here's what worked"** beats "Do this perfectly"
- Combine vulnerability with technical depth
- Tie to current trends in web development/architecture when possible

### Step 2: Structure the Post Using the Template

Use the template provided in `assets/medium_post_template.md` as the foundation. The proven structure is:

1. **Hook** (first 100 words): Personal story + specific promise
2. **Body** (900-1,400 words): 4-6 H2 sections with examples
3. **Conclusion** (100-200 words): Summary + call to action

**Target metrics:**
- **1,000-1,600 words total** (5-10 minute read time)
- **7 minutes is optimal** according to Medium data science research

### Step 3: Craft the Headline and Subtitle

The headline determines whether people click - invest time here.

**Headline Requirements:**
- **Under 60 characters** for shareability
- Use **odd numbers** (perform better than even)
- Be specific and benefit-driven

**Proven formulas:**
- "How I [achieved result] in [timeframe]"
- "[Number] Ways to [solve problem]"
- "Why [controversial statement]"
- "[Result] Without [common approach]"

**Subtitle Purpose:**
- Clarify the specific benefit
- Hook additional curiosity
- Promise concrete takeaway

### Step 4: Write with Optimal Formatting

Medium's algorithm heavily weights read completion. Proper formatting keeps readers engaged.

**Formatting Rules:**

**Structural Elements:**
- **H2 subheadings every 2-3 paragraphs** to chunk content
- **Short paragraphs** (2-4 sentences maximum)
- **Bullet points and numbered lists** for scanability
- **Pull quotes** for shareability (readers highlight and share these)

**Visual Elements:**
- **Featured image** (high-quality, relevant)
- **2-3 additional images/diagrams** throughout post
- Break up text every 2-3 paragraphs with visuals

**Code Formatting:**
- Use **inline code** for short snippets (backticks)
- Use **code blocks** for longer examples
- Add **syntax highlighting** when available
- Include **comments** explaining the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep examples **practical and immediately usable**

### Step 5: Apply Storytelling Elements

Technical posts go viral when they combine authentic storytelling with useful insights.

**Essential Story Elements:**

**Vulnerability:**
- Share real struggles and failures
- Include actual numbers/data from experience
- Admit what didn't work before finding the solution

**Emotion:**
- Frustrations experienced
- "Aha moments" and realizations
- Passion for the technology
- Admit what you don't know (builds trust)

**Progression:**
- What was tried that failed (relatability)
- The breakthrough moment (drama)
- The results (validation)

**Tone:**
- **Conversational but authoritative** - like explaining to a smart friend
- **Personal pronouns** ("I", "you", "we") create connection
- **Active voice** over passive voice
- **Short, punchy sentences** mixed with longer explanatory ones
- **Avoid jargon overload** - explain technical terms when first used

### Step 6: Optimize for Medium's Algorithm

Medium's algorithm prioritizes content that keeps readers engaged.

**Key Algorithmic Factors:**
- **Read ratio** - % who actually read vs. just click (most important)
- **Engagement time** - how long people spend reading
- **Claps** - quality of clapper matters (engaged users weighted more)
- **Highlights and shares** - signal value
- **Fan conversion** - non-followers clicking "follow"

**Optimization Tactics:**
- Strong hook in first 100 words (prevents bounces)
- H2 headers with compelling preview text (encourages scrolling)
- Pull quotes mid-article (encourages highlighting/sharing)
- Clear value delivery throughout (maintains engagement)
- Strong CTA at end (drives follows/claps)

**Publication Strategy:**
- **Submit to relevant publications** (2-10x reach multiplier)
  - Technical: freeCodeCamp, Level Up Coding, Towards Data Science
  - General: SWLH, Life Learning
- **Use 3-5 relevant tags** for topic-based distribution
- **Include credentials in bio** for social proof

### Step 7: Final Checklist Before Publishing

Review using the comprehensive checklist in `references/viral_medium_research.md`.

**Critical Items:**

Content Quality:
- [ ] 1,000-1,600 words (5-10 minute read)
- [ ] Personal story or unique angle included
- [ ] Specific, actionable takeaways provided
- [ ] Code examples are practical and tested

Formatting:
- [ ] Headline under 60 characters + descriptive subtitle
- [ ] H2 headers every 2-3 paragraphs

- [ ] Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- [ ] Featured image + 2-3 supporting visuals

Platform Optimization:

## Launch Strategy for Viral Success

The first hour is critical - **target 100 recommendations within 60 minutes**.

**Pre-Publishing:**
1. Identify target publication and reach out to editors
2. Prepare launch list (email subscribers, social followers)
3. Line up 10-20 people willing to share if they enjoy it

**First Hour (Critical):**
1. Email list immediately upon publishing
2. Personal outreach to 10-20 people for shares
3. Share on Twitter with engaging commentary
4. Post in relevant communities (LinkedIn, Reddit if appropriate)

**After Publishing:**
- Engage with every commenter
- Monitor performance and share milestones
- Keep promoting if hitting trending list

## Key Success Principles

**The Formula:**
Story + Solution beats Documentation
"Show your work" beats "Here's the answer"
"I struggled, here's what worked" beats "Do this perfectly"

**Non-Negotiables:**
- Real vulnerability + technical depth (not just one or the other)
- Professional formatting (H2s, quotes, images, code blocks)
- Specific, actionable value for readers
- Authentic human storytelling with useful technical insights

Remember: Technical posts go viral at the intersection of "I relate to this struggle" and "This actually solves my problem."
