description: Verifies template compliance of an agent/prompt that has been worked on in the current conversation
agent: prompter
---

## Instructions

Perform a comprehensive template compliance verification of the agent or prompt that has been modified in this conversation. Build a dynamic checklist based on the actual template requirements.

## Workflow

1. **Identify Target Artifact**
   - Look through recent conversation to identify which prompt file was being worked on
   - Read the current state of that file
   - Determine artifact type (primary/subagent/command) from frontmatter or context

2. **Create Base Compliance Checklist**
   Start with universal checks that apply to all templates add them to your todo list using todowrite:
   ```
   ## Universal Compliance Checks
   - [ ] Frontmatter exists and is properly formatted
   - [ ] Mode field matches file location (primary/subagent/command)
   - [ ] Description field is comprehensive and searchable
   - [ ] Tools section lists appropriate permissions
   - [ ] Variables defined are actually utilized in the prompt
   - [ ] No residual content from old versions
   - [ ] Emphasis keywords (CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, ALWAYS, NEVER) used strategically
   - [ ] Section sequence matches the template exactly
   - [ ] Section names match template formatting
   ```

3. **Add Template-Specific Checks**
   Based on the identified template type, ultrathink about:
   - What structural patterns are mandatory?
   - What formatting rules apply?
   - Instructions followed in each section?

   Then dynamically add todos for each template-specific requirement discovered through analysis. Let the actual template guide what needs to be verified rather than following predetermined checks.

4. **Execute Verification**
   Work through each todo item systematically using todoread/todowrite:
   - Mark as in_progress
   - Perform the specific check against the template
   - Document any deviations found
   - Mark as complete
   - Update todo list as you progress

5. **Generate Compliance Report**
   ```markdown
   ## Template Compliance Report: [Artifact Name]

   **Template Type**: [primary-agent | subagent | command]
   **File Path**: [location]

   ### ‚úÖ Compliant Areas:
   - [List what matches template requirements]

   ### ‚ùå Issues Found:
   - **[Issue Category]**: [Specific problem]
     - Location: Line [X]
     - Expected: [What template requires]
     - Found: [What's actually there]

   ### üîß Recommended Fixes:
   1. [Specific actionable fix]
   2. [Next fix with clear instructions]

   ### Verification Checklist Status:
   - Completed: [X/Y] checks
   - Issues found: [N]

   ### Overall Status: [‚úÖ COMPLIANT | ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR ISSUES | ‚ùå NEEDS FIXES]
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **CHECKPOINT** - Present compliance report and wait for user review before offering remediation

6. **Offer Remediation**
   If issues found: "Would you like me to fix these compliance issues now? I can address them in priority order using git-style diff format (see Communication Patterns in system prompt)."

## Note

This command adapts to any template type by dynamically building its checklist. The base checks ensure fundamental compliance, while template-specific checks are discovered through ULTRATHINK analysis of what the actual template requires, not predetermined rules.
