# Social Media Songwriter

## Overview

This skill enables creation of engaging, shareable songs optimized for social media platforms. It focuses on catchy hooks, memorable lyrics, and structures that work well in 15-60 second clips across TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Song Structure for Virality

Create songs with immediate hooks and engaging structures:

**Opening (0-3 seconds)**: Start with the catchiest part - no slow intros
- Lead with the hook or most memorable lyric
- Immediate rhythmic or melodic grab

**Main Hook (3-30 seconds)**: The shareable core
- Simple, repeatable lyrics (easy to remember and sing along)
- Clear melodic pattern
- Danceable or emotionally resonant rhythm

**Development (optional, 30-45 seconds)**: Add depth
- Verse that sets up or expands the hook
- Bridge for emotional contrast
- Keep it concise

**Outro (45-60 seconds)**: Strong ending
- Callback to hook
- Fade or button ending that loops well

### 2. Genre Defaults

Support popular social media genres:

**Pop**: Upbeat, melodic, feel-good energy
- 4/4 time, 120-140 BPM
- Major keys (C, G, D)
- Simple chord progressions (I-V-vi-IV or variants)

**Hip-Hop/Rap**: Rhythmic, punchy, quotable
- Strong beat emphasis
- Memorable one-liners
- Call-and-response patterns

**Indie/Alternative**: Relatable, emotional, authentic
- Conversational lyrics
- Unique vocal delivery
- Often minor keys or modal

### 3. Lyric Writing Principles

**Simplicity**: Easy to understand on first listen
- Short words, clear concepts
- Repetition of key phrases
- Minimal complex metaphors

**Relatability**: Universal themes that resonate
- Love, heartbreak, self-empowerment
- Daily life moments
- Current cultural trends (without dating quickly)

**Quotability**: Lines that people want to share
- Clever wordplay or puns
- Emotional one-liners
- "Sayable" phrases (how people actually talk)

**Singability**: Easy to sing along
- Natural speech rhythm
- Comfortable vocal range
- Clear rhyme schemes (AABB, ABAB, ABCB)

### 4. Output Format Options

**Lyrics Only**:
```
[Verse 1]
Lyric line one
Lyric line two

[Hook]
Catchy chorus line
Catchy chorus repeat
```

**Lyrics with Chords**:
```
[Intro]
C - G - Am - F

[Verse 1]
    C              G
Lyric line one here
    Am             F
Lyric line two here
```

**Lyrics with Production Notes**:
```
[Hook]
(Upbeat, claps on 2 and 4)
Catchy line with energy
(Add vocal layering/harmonies)
```

### 5. Platform-Specific Optimization

**TikTok**: 15-30 second focus
- Emphasize the most viral 15-second segment
- Consider dance potential
- Trending sound awareness

**Instagram Reels**: 30-60 seconds
- Balance between hook and development
- Visual storytelling sync potential

**YouTube Shorts**: Up to 60 seconds
- Can include more structure
- Stronger narrative arc possible

## Workflow

When a user requests a song:

1. **Identify the Request Type**:
   - Full song vs. hook/chorus only
   - Genre preference (default: pop if unspecified)
   - Theme or topic
   - Target platform (default: TikTok-optimized)

2. **Apply Viral Patterns** (see `references/viral_patterns.md` for details):
   - Use proven song structures
   - Apply platform-specific timing
   - Incorporate relatable themes

3. **Create the Content**:
   - Start with the hook (the most important part)
   - Build verses that support the hook
   - Ensure singability and quotability
   - Keep it concise and memorable

4. **Format the Output**:
   - Default: Lyrics with basic structure markers
   - If requested: Add chords, production notes, or melody suggestions
   - Include timing/structure notes for social media optimization

## Examples

**User**: "Write a catchy TikTok song about coffee addiction"

**Output**:
```
[Hook - 0:00-0:15]
Can't function 'til I get my cup
Caffeine runnin' through my veins, I'm up
Three espressos? That's not enough
I'm a coffee addict, yeah, that's my stuff

[Verse - 0:15-0:30]
Rolling out of bed like a zombie, yeah
First thought in my head: "Where's my coffee?"
Black, iced, or with oat milk foam
Doesn't matter, just give me my dose

[Hook Repeat - 0:30-0:45]
Can't function 'til I get my cup
Caffeine runnin' through my veins, I'm up

(Suggested: Upbeat pop, 128 BPM, C Major)
(Chords: C - G - Am - F throughout)
```

**User**: "Create a viral chorus for a heartbreak song"

**Output**:
```
[Hook]
You left me on read and I'm seeing red
All the words unsaid spinning in my head
I'm better off alone, that's what I said
But I still check my phone lying in my bed

(Emotional pop-indie vibe, 90 BPM)
(Chords: Am - F - C - G)
(Production: Sparse intro, build to full chorus)
```
