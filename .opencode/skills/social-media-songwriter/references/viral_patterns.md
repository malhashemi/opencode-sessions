# Viral Song Patterns for Social Media

## Common Viral Structures

### The Instant Hook Pattern
Start with the most memorable part immediately - no build-up.

**Example Structure**:
- 0-3s: Hook/Chorus (most catchy part)
- 3-20s: Verse building context
- 20-30s: Hook repeat or variation

**Why it works**: Captures attention instantly, crucial for scroll-through feeds.

### The Question-Answer Pattern
Pose a relatable question, then answer it with the hook.

**Example**:
- "You ever feel like..." (setup)
- "Yeah, I..." (hook/answer)

**Why it works**: Creates immediate relatability and engagement.

### The Crescendo Pattern
Build energy from quiet to explosive.

**Structure**:
- 0-10s: Sparse, intimate delivery
- 10-20s: Add layers (percussion, harmony)
- 20-30s: Full energy, memorable peak

**Why it works**: Creates satisfying payoff, good for emotional songs.

### The Loop Pattern
Designed to loop seamlessly for infinite replay.

**Structure**:
- 0-15s: Complete musical and lyrical phrase
- Ends on a note/chord that resolves back to beginning

**Why it works**: Encourages repeated listening, increases engagement metrics.

## Lyric Techniques for Virality

### Repetition Strategies
**Immediate Repeat**: Say the hook line twice in a row
```
"I'm done, I'm done with all your lies"
```

**Gradual Build**: Repeat with additions
```
"Running" → "Running fast" → "Running fast from my past"
```

**Echo/Call-Back**: Repeat key phrase throughout
```
Use same phrase to end each verse
```

### Wordplay That Works
**Homophones**: "I'm pacing/patients running low"

**Internal Rhymes**: "Sipping coffee in my office, feeling awesome, kinda toxic"

**Alliteration**: "Broken, bruised, but better believe I'll be back"

### Rhythm Patterns
**Syncopation**: Off-beat emphasis for energy
```
"I DON'T need NO permission to BE who I AM"
(Emphasis creates rhythmic interest)
```

**Staccato**: Short, punchy words
```
"Stop. Wait. Think. Choose."
```

**Flow**: Smooth, melodic delivery
```
"Floating through the motions like I'm swimming in the ocean"
```
